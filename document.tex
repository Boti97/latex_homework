\title{Dictionary Learning for Sparse Representation and Classification of Neural Spikes}

\maketitle
	
	\begin{abstract}
		Spike sorting is the problem of identifying and
		clustering neurons spiking activity from recorded extracellular
		electro-physiological data. This is important for experimental
		neuroscience. Existing approaches to solve this problem consist of
		three steps: spike detection, feature extraction, and clustering. In
		our method, we use Fisher discriminant based dictionary learning
		to learn dictionary, whose sub-dictionaries are class specific, and
		estimate discriminative sparse coding coefficients by minimizing
		the within class scatter and maximizing the between class scatter.
		Both the reconstruction error and coding coefficients are used
		for clustering the testing data. The dictionary learn the proper
		features specific to this problem. The proposed method has high
		reconstruction power and high clustering accuracy of testing
		data.
